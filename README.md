# Batchfetch - Efficiently clone or pull multiple Git repositories in parallel

## Introduction

Batchfetch is a command-line tool designed to clone, fetch, and merge multiple Git repositories simultaneously.

With Batchfetch, you no longer need to manually manage each repository one by one. It automates the tedious aspects of repository management, freeing you up to focus on what truly matters: your workflow.

Batchfetch is ideal for quickly cloning or pulling multiple Git repositories. It is also useful for cloning various addons, such as Vim plugins, Emacs packages, Ansible roles, Ansible collections, and other addons available on websites like GitHub, Codeberg, and GitLab.

## Features:
- Git Clone and Fetch/Merge: Clones the repositories and their submodules, ensuring that all the repositories are always up-to-date by fetching and merging changes.
- Parallel Operations: Utilizes threads to simultaneously Git clone or pull multiple repositories, dramatically reducing wait times.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides simple and straightforward command-line options that make it easy to get started and effectively manage your repositories.
- Custom Configuration: Allows the use of a YAML configuration file to specify and manage the repositories you interact with, enabling repeatable setups and consistent environments.

## Installation

```
pip install --user batchfetch
```

The pip command above will install the `batchfetch` executable in the directory `~/.local/bin/`.

## Example

Here is an example of a `batchfetch.yaml` file:

```yaml
---

tasks:
  # Clone the default branch of the general.el repository to the
  # './general.el' directory
  - git: https://github.com/noctuid/general.el

  # Clone the tag 1.5 of the consult repository to the './consult'
  # directory
  - git: https://github.com/minad/consult
    reference: "1.5"

  # Clone the s.el repository to the './another-name.el' directory
  - git: https://github.com/magnars/s.el
    path: another-name.el
    reference: dda84d38fffdaf0c9b12837b504b402af910d01d

  # Delete './impatient-mode'
  - git: https://github.com/skeeto/impatient-mode
    delete: true
```

Execute the `batchfetch` command from the same directory as `batchfetch.yml` to make it clone or update the local copies of the repositories above.
